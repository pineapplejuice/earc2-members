Dear {{member.first_name}} {{member.callsign}},

Welcome to the Emergency Amateur Radio Club!  On behalf of the EARC board of directors, I am pleased to acknowledge receipt of your membership application and new member dues of ${{amount}}, received {{payment_date}} via PayPal.  This email will serve as your dues receipt.  Your membership is valid until {{member.membership_expires}}.

Your dues support our club activities as well as our extensive linked repeater network, so we are grateful for your support.

Our club holds nets on most nights on the linked EARC/DEM Repeater System, and we welcome new hams and old-timers alike. We also hold social events throughout the year, including ARRL Field Day and Mini Field Days through the year. You can find more information on our upcoming club activities at our club website, www.earchi.org.
 
We cordially invite you to attend an upcoming General Membership Meeting. We meet on the third Tuesday of each month at 7:00 p.m., at Fleet Reserve Association Branch 49, 891 Valkenburgh Street, Honolulu, Hawaii (at the Ewa end of the H-1 airport viaduct).

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact myself any of our officers. 

Mahalo and 73,

Keith K. Higa, WH7GG
Treasurer
